# Image Label Prediction and Sentiment Analysis

&nbsp;

## Motivation and Objectives
These are 2 university projects designed to teach students how to use CNN's and transformer models, respectively, while working with real datasets.

For the CNN project, the intent is for me to design such a model from scratch in order to predict image labels. Regarding the transformer project, I need to fine-tune RoBERTa, a pre-trained transformer model, to perform sentiment analysis on text data.

The final objectives are to reach a final test accuracy > 75% for the CNN model, and a final F$_1$-score > 0.77 for the fine-tuned RoBERTa model.

## Requirements

To run both notebooks, first install dependencies using pip:

```Python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Source of the Data
The datasets used for these projects were provided by the University.

## Datasets Descriptions
For the CNN project there are 10000 images as training examples with their respective labels, and also 10000 images serving as test set.

As for the transformer project, there are 12100 text files as training examples, also accompanied by their respective labels, and 2000 text files for the test set.

Sadly, I was not provided with test set labels for either project, having the final test scores been evaluated upon submitting each project to an online university submission platform.

No more information on the data was given.
